<p>
Polar bears have thick, whitish fur covering black skin. The fur and a thick layer of fat keep them warm. The black skin helps to absorb heat from the Sun. Polar bears even have fur on the soles of their feet. This fur protects the feet and keeps them from slipping. Sharp claws also help polar bears to walk on ice and to kill prey.
